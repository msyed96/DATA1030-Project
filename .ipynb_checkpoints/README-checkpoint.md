# DATA1030-Project
## Maheen Syed, Brown University, 2019




<h2>Introduction</h2>
The goal of this project is to examine the different ways in which educational attainment may be
impacted in classroom settings. I work with the Student Performance in a Mathematics Classroom in Portugal dataset retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
<br>

I employ five main procedures to my dataset in this project:
- Preprocessing
- EDA
- Develop ML models using Cross validation methods
- Find best model 
- Predict Results using best Model
</br>

<h2>Versions used</h2>
Most of my analysis was carried out on JupyterHub (except for one process done locally) with the following specifications: <br>
- Python - 3.7.3 <br>
- sklearn - 0.21.3 <br>
- matplotlib  - 3.1.1 <br>
- numpy - 1.17.1
