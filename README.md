# Introduction

This repository was created as the final project for Brown University Graduate Class: Data 1030. 

The goal of this project is to examine the different ways in which educational attainment may be
impacted in classroom settings. 

I work with the Student Performance in a Mathematics Classroom in Portugal dataset retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
